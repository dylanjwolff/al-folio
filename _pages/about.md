I'm a graduate student at ETH Zurich pursuing a masters in
Computer Science with a focus in Information Security. Specifically I am
interested in leveraging static and dynamic program analysis (as well as
verification) techniques to find and prevent bugs in software. Before starting
my masters, I worked at Mathworks on a variety of projects, mostly involving
testing and deployment infrastructure for web applications.

I'm also a recovering ultimate frisbee addict, after 12 years of
competitive play, starting in high school. In that time I've played in two
different semi-professional leagues and also won a world championship in 2013
with team USA in Toronto.
